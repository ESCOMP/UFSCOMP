# UFSCOMP

The **Unified Forecast System Community Portal (UFSCOMP)** is an entry point for community members interested in obtaining NOAAâ€™s Unified Forecast System (UFS) for their own interests and experimentation. The UFS utilizes a set of forecast system software components to build a suite of targeted, predictive applications spanning spatial and temporal scales. It will include multiple Earth system model components (e.g. atmosphere, ocean, sea ice) and software to support a complete forecast workflow including data pre-processing, data assimilation, model coupling, ensemble and probabilistic processing, post-processing, and experiment management. *At this time, UFSCOMP includes only a small subset of the UFS.*

It has historically been difficult to share operational code in a manner that promotes meaningful and timely collaboration with the research community. Often, a researcher was required to have inside knowledge or have access to "super-users" to understand the nuances of running the modeling system. This portal aims to reduce these barriers and simplify UFS access by providing the needed linkages to model component and infrastructure code located in distributed repositories. These linkages change based on the particular UFS application (e.g. FV3GFS) and the particular version of that application requested, making it difficult to assemble a working application without prior knowledge of the constituent components. To address this, UFSCOMP provides configurations of UFS components that are versioned, documented, tested, and have clearly identified supported platforms/machines and dependencies.
